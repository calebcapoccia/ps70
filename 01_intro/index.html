<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
<p></p>I currently have three ideas for my final project. The first one is much more flushed out than the other two because I believe it will be the most feasible, but I am happy to explore and discuss the other two further.</p>
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1: Kachow</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

<image src="./kachow.png" alt="Lightning McQueen"></image>

<p>The idea behind this project is to create a voice to text system that integrates with an LED display that sits at the front and back windows of a car, allowing a driver to 'speak' to other cars.</p>

<p>I would need to design and fabricate a housing and attachment mechanism for the display that would allow me to house LEDs and attach it to the inside of both the front and back windows.</p>

<p>I would use microcontroller programming to communicate with and display messages on the LED matrix. While I could use an app to capture voice to text and then choose which display (front or back) to send a message to, it might be better to use a separate microphone and buttons for better integration of input devices.</p>

<p>Finally, I imagine this would require some sort of bluetooth connection if I do not have all of the devices (input mic and buttons, and both LED displays) connected via cables.</p>

<p>Last summer, I built a scrappy primitive version of this, which I demo in the below video:</p>

<p>I would like to expand this project and build more of the components from primitives.</p>

<h4>Idea 2: CKM</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

<p>Health tracking, particularly around diet, is very important to me, as experimentation with my diet has played a pivotal role in maintaining my health.  Tracking ketones is important for understanding if you are in ketosis, which is the key part of the 'ketogenic' diet. Continuous glucose monitors are quite popular, but there are currently no commercial ketone monitors. I think it would be interesting to explore building a ketone monitor, similar to a CGM, but instead of measuring glucose, it would measure ketones.</p>

<p>While I think this would involve multiple components of what we are learning throughout the course like 3D design and input/output, I am afraid this might enter more into the realm of chemistry, and be analogous to the 'signal processing hell' Nathan warned about.</p>

<h4>Idea 3: Lego Builder</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

<p>The idea behind this would be a platform with several robotic arms that could identify and pick up Lego pieces and place them in the correct position to build a Lego set.</p>

<p>While I think this would be a fun project, I imagine processing an instruction manual (even if digital), along with identifying the pieces and constructing in 3D space where to place them, would prove to be much more of a software challenge than a digital fabrication one.</p>
