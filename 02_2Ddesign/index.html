<h3>Week 2: 2D Design & Cutting</h3>

<h4>Assignment 1: Make a Box</h4>

<p>I followed the initial tutorial to design a box in fusion, as seen below:</p>
<img src="./week2_1.png" alt="Box" style="max-width: 600px;">

<p>I then wanted to think about how I might personalize my box. Given my love of film, I decided to design my box to be a box television, modeled after a 1960s Admiral Television set like <a href="https://furnishgreen.com/products/mid-century-admiral-television-online-only" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p>
<img src="./week2_2.webp" alt="Old TV" style="max-width: 600px;">
<img src="./week2_3.webp" alt="Old TV" style="max-width: 600px;">
<img src="./week2_4.webp" alt="Old TV" style="max-width: 600px;">

<p>According to the site, the dimensions are 29.5 W, 17 D, 28 H. The absolute maximum height is 250 mm for storage in the lab, so I decided to scale height to be 230 mm, which would mean factor of 8.21428571429 = ~8.214. Scaling the rest of the dimensions we get W = ~242.3 mm = 240mm and D = 139.6 mm.</p>

<p>For the features on the front and back of the box, I am planned to use scoring, as opposed to cutting separate pieces, as it would add the style with the same level of functionality as a traditional box. The legs would be built into the sides of the box so that it maintains structure along the side. The top of the box is built into the back with scoring to bend for opening. I realized though that to make this one continuous piece to fold, fingers at the bottom would not hold together vertically, so switched to a slot design that would support the bottom. I decided before adding additional features to print out the initial design:</p>

<img src="./week2_5.png" alt="Fusion original" style="max-width: 600px;">

<p>I quickly realized though when trying to print that the dimensions were too big for the printer, so I had to scale down the design. The quickest way for me to do this was to scale up the side fingers by the inverse of the new aspect ratio (3/4), and then scale the entire object down in Rhino.</p>

<p>This is the first iteration, which turned out quite well!</p>

<p>I then added the additional styling with scoring and etching:</p>

<img src="./week2_8.jpg" alt="Final box design back" style="max-width: 600px;">

<p>Finally, I glued some of the connecting edges to keep the box together and added velco to the lid to keep it shut.</p>

<h4>Assignment 2: Fusion 360 Tutorial</h4>

<p>I followed the first two videos in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A&t=38s" target="_blank">YouTube tutorial series</a> that was recommended to build the toy block and the glass bottle:</p>

<h4>Assignment 3: Fusion Modeling</h4>

<p>The first item I modeled was a curve claw hammer:</p>

<p>Next I decided to model my phone, including all of the slight intricacies of the camera, side buttons, bottom speakers, and charging slot.</p>
